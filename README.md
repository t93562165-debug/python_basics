# python_basics

This repository is my learning space for Python basics.  
Here I practice programming by building small scripts, solving exercises, and sharing my progress step by step.  

## About me
My name is Tanya, I’m 16 years old and just starting my programming journey.  
My main goal is to become a professional Python developer, build real projects, and share my experience with others.  

## What you’ll find here
- Fundamental Python topics (variables, strings, loops, functions, files)  
- Small exercises and mini-projects  
- Notes and examples for future reference  

## Why this project
This repository is my **learning diary in code**.  
I use it to track my growth, stay consistent, and prepare for more advanced projects.  

## Future plans
- Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Work with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Flask  
- Build projects: bots, web apps, data analysis tools  
- Share my journey on GitHub and in my blog
